# STR-E912-FreeRTOS
Here are some my experiments on GCC builds of FreeRTOS on specific board Olimex STR-E912

Some time ago, I bought from ebay a development board made by Olimex, the STR-E912.

After some trials I got the fast way to upload firmware on it.

Since I dont want to buy nor install on my own pc others tools, I searched for a hand build tool.

For compiling I use em_armgcc that I've downloaded somewhere...;)

From that point I had to find how to put the firmware inside it, so I managed to setup a Raspberry PI with openocd.
